My New Code:
(It's called an Ag Ram Cypher)

Salutations Connor,
    I know you decoded my last cypher, but I hope
Ill stump you for once with this newer version. However,
if you outsmart my genius again I can decisively
conclude you are excellent at cryptography.
With much deviousness and cleverness,
-Eli
